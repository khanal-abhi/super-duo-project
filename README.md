# super-duo-project
This is the third project for android nanodegree. I need to make these two apps work as demanded by the reviewers. This includes Layout Mirroring, External Library as well as Error handling.

##Alexandria
It is a book app. Here the user able to type in an ISBN, which in turn loads the details about the book as well as lets the user save the book. There are a lot of error cases. The lack of null checks throw a plethora of NPE. There is a scan button that is not implemented(to scan the barcode of the book) and even orientation change crashes it.
This repo will have fixed all the errors and implemented the scan ability as well.
